## Credits 
I would like to acknowledge the valuable input from my tutor Jose Lopez. I had some things 
in this challenge confused with other Challenges, particularly in my approach to the schema.
He cleared that up for me and helped me gain more insight into using the errors as the 
valuable tool that they are. He also clarified the importance of not messing with the starter
code. Lesson learned! I'm so thankful for Jose, and the really great tutors that have taught me
so much about using the tools that are right under my nose.
